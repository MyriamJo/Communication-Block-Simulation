# Communication-Block-Simulation

## Programming Language
MATLAB

## Description
This project simulates a communication block that includes sampling, quantization, encoding, and decoding processes. The goal is to accurately transmit baseband signals through a noiseless channel channel while encoding and decoding the signal using Huffman Source coding.

## Communication Block Diagram
Input -> Sampler -> Quantizer -> Encoder -> Source Encoder -> Channel -> Source Decoder -> Decoder -> Output

## Specifications
- **Input Signal:** sinusoidal wave over 15 seconds
- **Sampling:** 1 sample every 2 seconds
- **Quantization:** 16-level quantizer
- **Encoding:** Decimal format encoding
- **Source Encoding:** Huffman Source encoding
- **Channel:** Noiseless channel
- **Decoding:** Consistent with encoding scheme
- **Source Decoding:** Huffman Source decoding
